OmniFocus2Reminders - Sync
Created by: Sean Korzdorfer
Created on: 10/23/12 08:53:07
Version: 1.0

## Overview

Send all tasks found for the contexts listed in the property contextList to Reminders.app. 
To be used by OF2Reminders or OF2Reminders-batch

## Use Case

I like to keep my errand tasks in OmniFocus, but I also want the convenience of shared family shopping lists
via Reminders.

## Notes

You can use this script with OF2Reminders and OF2Reminders-batch to complete the tasks in 
 OmniFocus once they have been completed in Reminders. 
 
 You can run the script in the background by either creating a launchd item or by using Keyboard Maestro

Requirements:

- In order to send tasks to multiple Reminders lists, the Reminders app list name MUST MATCH the OmniFocus context name.
- To use OF2Reminders-sync script, the notes added to both the OmniFocus and Reminders tasks MUST exist.
